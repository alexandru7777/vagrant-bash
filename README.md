# vagrant-bash

In this folder-project I have posted some scripts that I created and used in both local and cloud environment.

On one side we have automation made with vagrant and bash scripts, and on the other side there are also two ansible folders contining two simple projects.

For the ansible project it would require 3 vms, one for the Ansible Control Machine and 2 web servers with CentOS.
